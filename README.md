# StudySpace Repository

Welcome to **StudySpace**, a personal repository where I track and share my learning journey through various programming stacks and technologies. This repository serves as a collection of knowledge, experiments, and projects related to the different subjects I’ve dived into. It's designed to provide a glimpse into my continuous learning process.

## What's the Goal of StudySpace?
The goal of StudySpace is simple: to learn in public. By sharing my learning journey openly, I aim to document my progress, connect with others, and hopefully inspire or help anyone interested in similar topics. Whether it’s a course, a hands-on experiment, or an article that I’ve explored, it will likely find a place here.

> **Note:** This is a living repository! It does not contain everything I have ever studied or am studying. It’s an ongoing project that evolves as I learn and grow.

## What Can You Expect Here?
StudySpace is organized by technology or stack. Each folder corresponds to a specific area of interest, and many of these folders include submodules pointing to private repositories I’m actively working on. 

Here’s the current structure:

```
.
├── README.md
├── datascience         # Projects and notes on data science
├── go                  # Go language-related learning and projects
├── python              # Python experiments and resources
└── typescript          # TypeScript-focused content
    └── pro-essentials-workshop  # Workshop and hands-on learning
```

### A Few Things to Keep in Mind:
- **Dynamic Content:** Since this is a current repository, you’ll find only a snapshot of my learning journey at any given time.
- **Submodules:** Some folders include submodules linking to specific projects or repositories I’m working on. While these might remain private, they give context to what I’m exploring.
- **Friendly Collaboration:** I’ve made this public to share my process and hopefully connect with like-minded learners. Feel free to explore and even suggest new areas to dive into!

## How to Use This Repository
StudySpace is meant to be both a personal tracker and a resource for inspiration. If you’re:
- **Curious about new stacks:** Browse the folders to see how I approach learning a technology.
- **Looking for motivation:** Use this as an example of how you can document and organize your learning journey.

## Get in Touch
If something here sparks your interest or if you want to share ideas, feel free to reach out! I’d love to connect and exchange thoughts on learning and building.

Happy learning, and welcome to StudySpace!
